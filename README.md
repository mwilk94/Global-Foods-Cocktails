## Global Foods and Cocktails

Due to the heavy  restrictions  because of Covid many people are unable to
travel. 

We have designed a website for people who 
wish to explore culture through foods in a simplistic yet sophisticated way
-The-Cloud-Beaters
   
## GitHub Repository Name

Global Foods and Cocktails

## Framework & Features

The website was built using Javascript, Html, Bulma and Cascading Style Sheets; and 
integrated the server-side API's, Edamame and Spoonacular. It also uses client side storage.
The Graphical User Interface is simple, attractive, easy to use  and is responsive, 
adapting to multiple screen sizes.

## Deployment Link

## Page Layout and Features

Our page layout consists of a header with a button and dropped down list that searches foods and cocktail API's.  
There is also a search area that  queries for specific foods/ingredients. 
The results are displayed in columns on cards with pictures.  When the recipe is selected the corresponding site 
is displayed.
